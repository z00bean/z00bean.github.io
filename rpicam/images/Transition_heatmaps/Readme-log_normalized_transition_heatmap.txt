The log normalized transition heatmap visualizes vehicle transitions between regions (e.g., Red → White, Green → Blue) over time, with each row representing a unique hour (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD HH) and each column corresponding to a specific region-to-region transition.

To enhance interpretability, especially for transitions with highly skewed vehicle counts, the values are log-transformed using base-10 normalization. This helps highlight both low-frequency and high-frequency transitions in a visually balanced way.
